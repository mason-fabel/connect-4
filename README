OVERVIEW
========

Connect 4 game for use by artificial intelligence programs.


DEPENDENCIES
============

This project requires gradle to be installed in order to build and run.


COMPILING
=========

Before building this project for the first time, gradle must be configured. The
following command will set everything up properly.

$ gradle wrapper

Once this is done, subsequent builds can be completed using the gradle command.

$ gradle build


RUNNING
=======

The program is also run by the gradle command. I reccommend using the quiet flag
-q in order to keep the output clean.

$ gradle run -q
